Beer App Requirements:
    - The app should have 2 screens.
    - 1 screen is for beer list screen and 1 is for beer details screen
    - Tapping on a beer from beer list screen should open beer details screen
    - It should use the coordinator pattern to achieve the navigation: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/71/how-to-use-the-coordinator-pattern-in-ios-apps

    - Beer list screen:
        - each item should contain: image, name, first brewed, contributed by, attenuation level
        - nice to have: pagination (API supports it, not implemented here yet)

    - Beer detail screen:
        - info to display: image, name, first brewed, contributed by, attenuation level, ingredients, food parity
